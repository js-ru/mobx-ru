# What does MobX react to?

MobX usually reacts to exactly the things you expect it to.
Which means that in 90% of your use cases mobx "just works".
However, at some point you will encounter a case where it might not do what you expected.
At that point it is invaluable to understand how MobX determines what to react to.

> MobX reacts to any _existing_ **observable** _property_ that is read during the execution of a tracked function.

* _"reading"_ is dereferencing an object's property, which can be done through "dotting into" it (eg. `user.name`) or using the bracket notation (eg. `user['name']`).
* _"trackable functions"_ are the expression of `computed`, the `render()` method of an observer component, and the functions that are passed as the first param to `when`, `reaction` and `autorun`.
* _"during"_ means that only those observables that are being read while the function is executing are tracked. It doesn't matter whether these values are used directly or indirectly by the tracked function.

In other words, MobX will not react to:
 * Values that are obtained from observables, but outside a tracked function
 * Observables that are read in an asynchronously invoked code block

## MobX tracks property access, not values

To elaborate on the above rules with an example, suppose that you have the following observable data structure (`observable` applies itself recursively by default, so all fields in this example are observable):

```javascript
let message = observable({
    title: "Foo",
    author: {
        name: "Michel"
    },
    likes: [
        "John", "Sara"
    ]
})
```

In memory that looks as follows. The green boxes indicate _observable_ properties. Note that the _values_ themselves are not observable!

![MobX reacts to changing references](../images/observed-refs.png)

Now what MobX basically does is recording which _arrows_ you use in your function. After that, it will re-run whenever one of this _arrows_ changes; when they start to refer to something else.

## Examples

Lets show that with a bunch of examples (based on the `message` variable defined above):

#### Correct: dereference inside the tracked function

```javascript
autorun(() => {
    console.log(message.title)
})
message.title = "Bar"
```

This will react as expected, the `.title` property was dereferenced by the autorun, and changed afterwards, so this change is detected.

You can verify what MobX will track by calling [`trace()`](../reguide/trace) inside the tracked function. In the case of the above function it will output the following:

```javascript
const disposer = autorun(() => {
    console.log(message.title)
    trace()
})

// Outputs:
// [mobx.trace] 'Autorun@2' tracing enabled

message.title = "Hello"
// [mobx.trace] 'Autorun@2' is invalidated due to a change in: 'ObservableObject@1.title'
```

It is also possible to get the internal dependency (or observer) tree by using the designated utilities for that:

```javascript
getDependencyTree(disposer) // prints the dependency tree of the reaction coupled to the disposer
// { name: 'Autorun@4',
//  dependencies: [ { name: 'ObservableObject@1.title' } ] }
```

#### Incorrect: changing a non-observable reference

```javascript
autorun(() => {
    console.log(message.title)
})
message = observable({ title: "Bar" })
```

This will **not** react. `message` was changed, but `message` is not an observable, just a variable which _refers to_ an observable,
but the variable (reference) itself is not observable.


#### Incorrect: dereference outside a tracked function

```javascript
var title = message.title;
autorun(() => {
    console.log(title)
})
message.title = "Bar"
```

This will **not** react. `message.title` was dereferenced outside the `autorun`, and just contains the value of `message.title` at the  moment of dereferencing (the string `"Foo"`).
`title` is not an observable so `autorun` will never react.

#### Correct: dereference inside the tracked function

```javascript
autorun(() => {
    console.log(message.author.name)
})
message.author.name = "Sara";
message.author = { name: "John" };
```

This will react to both changes. Both `author` and `author.name` are dotted into, allowing MobX to track these references.

#### Incorrect: store a local reference to an observable object without tracking

```javascript
const author = message.author;
autorun(() => {
    console.log(author.name)
})
message.author.name = "Sara";
message.author = { name: "John" };
```

The first change will be picked up, `message.author` and `author` are the same object, and the `.name` property is dereferenced in the autorun.
However the second change will **not** be picked up, the `message.author` relation is not tracked by the `autorun`. Autorun is still using the "old" `author`.

#### Common pitfall: console.log

```javascript
const message = observable({ title: "hello" })

autorun(() => {
    console.log(message)
})

// Won't trigger a re-run
message.title = "Hello world"
```

In the above example, the updated message title won't be printed, because it is not used inside the autorun.
The autorun only depends on `message`, which is not an observable, but a constant. In other words, as far as MobX is concerned, `title` is not used in- and hence not relevant for the `autorun`

The fact that `console.log` will print the message title is misleading here; `console.log` is an asynchronous api that only will format its parameters later in time, for which reason the autorun won't be tracking what data the console.log is accessing. For that reason make sure to always pass immutable data or defensive copies to `console.log`.

The following solutions however, will all react to `message.title`:

```javascript
autorun(() => {
    console.log(message.title) // clearly, the `.title` observable is used
})

autorun(() => {
    console.log(mobx.toJS(message)) // toJS creates a deep clone, and thus will read the message
})

autorun(() => {
    console.log({...message}) // creates a shallow clone, also using `.title` in the process
})

autorun(() => {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(message)) // also reads the entire structure
})
```

#### Correct: access array properties in tracked function


```javascript
autorun(() => {
    console.log(message.likes.length);
})
message.likes.push("Jennifer");
```

This will react as expected. `.length` counts towards a property.
Note that this will react to *any* change in the array.
Arrays are not tracked per index / property (like observable objects and maps) but as a whole.

#### Incorrect: access out-of-bounds indices in tracked function

```javascript
autorun(() => {
    console.log(message.likes[0]);
})
message.likes.push("Jennifer");
```

This will react with the above sample data, array indexers count as property access. But **only** if the provided `index < length`.
MobX will not track not-yet-existing indices or object properties (except when using maps).
So always guard your array index based access with a `.length` check.

#### Correct: access array functions in tracked function

```javascript
autorun(() => {
    console.log(message.likes.join(", "));
})
message.likes.push("Jennifer");
```

This will react as expected. All array functions that do not mutate the array are tracked automatically.

---

```javascript
autorun(() => {
    console.log(message.likes.join(", "));
})
message.likes[2] = "Jennifer";
```

This will react as expected. All array index assignments are detected, but only if `index <= length`.

#### Incorrect: "use" an observable but without accessing any of its properties

```javascript
autorun(() => {
    message.likes;
})
message.likes.push("Jennifer");
```

This will **not** react. Simply because the `likes` array itself is not being used by the `autorun`, only the reference to the array.
So in contrast, `messages.likes = ["Jennifer"]` would be picked up; that statement does not modify the array, but the `likes` property itself.

#### Using non-observable object properties


```javascript
autorun(() => {
    console.log(message.postDate)
})
message.postDate = new Date()
```

_MobX 4_

This will **not** react. MobX can only track observable properties, and 'postDate' has not been defined as observable property above.
However, it is possible to use the `get` and `set` methods as exposed by MobX to work around this:

```javascript
autorun(() => {
    console.log(get(message, "postDate"))
})
set(message, "postDate",  new Date())
```

_MobX 5_

In MobX 5 this **will** react, as MobX 5 can track not-yet existing properties.
Note that this is only done for objects created with `observable` or `observable.object`.
New properties on class instances will not be made observable automatically.

#### [MobX 4 and lower] Incorrect: using not yet existing observable object properties

```javascript
autorun(() => {
    console.log(message.postDate)
})
extendObservable(message, {
    postDate: new Date()
})
```

This will **not** react. MobX will not react to observable properties that did not exist when tracking started.
If the two statements are swapped, or if any other observable causes the `autorun` to re-run, the `autorun` will start tracking the `postDate` as well.


#### Correct: using not yet existing map entries

```javascript
const twitterUrls = observable.map({
    "John": "twitter.com/johnny"
})

autorun(() => {
    console.log(twitterUrls.get("Sara"))
})
twitterUrls.set("Sara", "twitter.com/horsejs")
```

This **will** react. Observable maps support observing entries that may not exist.
Note that this will initially print `undefined`.
You can check for the existence of an entry first by using `twitterUrls.has("Sara")`.
So for dynamically keyed collections, always use observable maps.

#### Correct: using MobX utilities to read / write to objects

Since MobX 4 it is also possible to use observable objects as dynamic collection, if they are read / updated by using the mobx apis, so that mobx can keep track of the property changes. The following will react as well:


```javascript
import { get, set, observable } from "mobx"

const twitterUrls = observable.object({
    "John": "twitter.com/johnny"
})

autorun(() => {
    console.log(get(twitterUrls, "Sara")) // get can track not yet existing properties
})
set(twitterUrls, { "Sara" : "twitter.com/horsejs"})
```

See the [object manipulation api](https://mobx.js.org/refguide/api.html#direct-observable-manipulation) for more details

## MobX only tracks synchronously accessed data

```javascript
function upperCaseAuthorName(author) {
    const baseName = author.name;
    return baseName.toUpperCase();
}
autorun(() => {
    console.log(upperCaseAuthorName(message.author))
})
message.author.name = "Chesterton"
```
This will react. Even though `author.name` is not dereferenced by the thunk passed to `autorun` itself,
MobX will still track the dereferencing that happens in `upperCaseAuthorName`,
because it happens _during_ the execution of the autorun.

----

```javascript
autorun(() => {
    setTimeout(
        () => console.log(message.likes.join(", ")),
        10
    )
})
message.likes.push("Jennifer");
```

This will **not** react, during the execution of the `autorun` no observables where accessed, only during the `setTimeout`.
In general this is quite obvious and rarely causes issues.

## MobX only tracks data accessed for `observer` components if they are directly accessed by `render`

A common mistake made with `observer` is that it doesnt track data that syntactically seems parent of the `observer` component,
but in practice is actually rendered out by a different component. This often happens when render callbacks of components are passed in first class to another component.

Take for example the following contrived example:

```javascript
const MyComponent = observer(({ message }) =>
    <SomeContainer
        title = {() => <div>{message.title}</div>}
    />
)

message.title = "Bar"
```

At first glance everything might seem ok here, except that the `<div>` is actually not rendered by `MyComponent` (which has a tracked rendering), but by `SomeContainer`.
So to make sure that the title of `SomeContainer` correctly reacts to a new `message.title`, `SomeContainer` should be an `observer` as well.

If `SomeContainer` comes from an external lib, this is often not under your own control. In that case you can address this by either wrapping the `div` in its own stateless `observer` based component, or by leveraging the `<Observer>` component:

```javascript
const MyComponent = observer(({ message }) =>
    <SomeContainer
        title = {() => <TitleRenderer message={message} />}
    />
)

const TitleRenderer = observer(({ message }) =>
    <div>{message.title}</div>}
)

message.title = "Bar"
```

Alternatively, to avoid creating additional components, it is also possible to use the mobx-react built-in `Observer` component, which takes no arguments, and a single render function as children:

```javascript
const MyComponent = ({ message }) =>
    <SomeContainer
        title = {() =>
            <Observer>
                {() => <div>{message.title}</div>}
            </Observer>
        }
    />

message.title = "Bar"
```

## Avoid caching observables in local fields

A common mistake is to store local variables that dereference observables, and then expect components to react. For example:

```javascript
@observer class MyComponent extends React.component {
    author;
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.author = props.message.author;
    }

    render() {
        return <div>{this.author.name}</div>
    }
}
```

This component will react to changes in the `author`'s name, but it won't react to changing the `.author` of the `message` itself! Because that dereferencing happened outside `render()`,
which is the only tracked function of an `observer` component.
Note that even marking the `author` component field as `@observable` field does not solve this; that field is still assigned only once.
This can simply be solved by doing the dereferencing inside `render()`, or by introducing a computed property on the component instance:

```javascript
@observer class MyComponent extends React.component {
    @computed get author() {
        return this.props.message.author
    }
// ...
```

## How multiple components will render

Suppose that the following components are used to render our above `message` object.

```javascript
const Message = observer(({ message }) =>
    <div>
        {message.title}
        <Author author={ message.author } />
        <Likes likes={ message.likes } />
    </div>
)

const Author = observer(({ author }) =>
    <span>{author.name}</span>
)

const Likes = observer(({ likes }) =>
    <ul>
        {likes.map(like =>
            <li>{like}</li>
        )}
    </ul>
)
```

| change | re-rendering component |
| --- | --- |
| `message.title = "Bar"` | `Message` |
| `message.author.name = "Susan"` | `Author` (`.author` is dereferenced in `Message`, but didn't change)* |
| `message.author = { name: "Susan"}` | `Message`, `Author` |
| `message.likes[0] = "Michel"` | `Likes` |

Notes:
1. \* If the `Author` component was invoked like: `<Author author={ message.author.name} />`. Then `Message` would be the dereferencing component and react to changes to `message.author.name`. Nonetheless `<Author>` would rerender as well, because it receives a new value. So performance wise it is best to dereference as late as possible.
2. \** If likes were objects instead of strings, and if they were rendered by their own `Like` component, the `Likes` component would not rerender for changes happening inside a specific like.

## TL;DR

> MobX reacts to any _existing_ **observable** _property_ that is read during the execution of a tracked function.
